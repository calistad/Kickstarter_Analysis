# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis

## Overview of Project
A playwright, Louise, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise to analyze crowdfunding data and determine any specific factors that make a project’s campaign successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
The filter method is very helpful according to the large data sets. Thus, we will be able to form a smaller data set that focuses on more specific topics. Then we can create various charts such as a pivot table and a pivot chart to analyze or to compare.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the US, theater has the most successful rate. From the subcategory of theater, plays have the most successful rate. May and June have the highest failure rate, but also have the highest success rate. October also has a very high failure rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Furthermore, Campaigns with a lower amount of goals such as less than $5,000, have the highest percentage of success. Campaigns with a relatively high amount of goals have the highest percentage of fail. The data indicated that the campaigns that failed were because of asking for too much money. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Additionally, when using the COUNTIFS() formula, make sure to include all the criteria that are needed. Otherwise, the results can be very different.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Louise should launch the campaigns during May or June since these months has the highest success rate. If she couldn’t, make sure she avoids launching in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Louise should try to reduce her budget from $10,000 to at most $5,000 or less to gain success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One of the limitations is the time frame. The campaigns that got choose should have more modern launch dates such as in the recent five years, instead of for almost ten years, which may cause some inaccuracy. Also, the currency is different due to the different countries, this may cause confusion when compared the amount for goals and pledged. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Moreover, we can also create a chart for the outcomes based on the launched time’s length, to analyze some relations.
